**Algerian Forest Fires**

Problem statementÂ¶

The problem we aim to solve here is predicting the Fire Weather Index (FWI) for the Bejaia and Sidi Bel-abbes regions in Algeria. The FWI is an important measure of fire danger, which indicates the likelihood of forest fires based on weather conditions. By using regression algorithms, we want to build a mathematical model that can understand how different weather factors (like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and rain) and FWI components (FFMC, DMC, DC, ISI, BUI) influence the FWI.
To achieve this, we will use the available historical data to train the regression models. This data contains information about weather conditions and corresponding FWI values for various days from June to September in 2012. Once the models are trained, we can use them to make predictions about the FWI for future dates based on the expected weather conditions.
The ultimate aim is to have accurate models that can help us predict the Fire Weather Index, which can be valuable for fire management and prevention strategies in these regions of Algeria.













**Conclusion**
* In both cases, the R2 Score is quite high, which means that both models do a good job of explaining the variation in the data and making accurate predictions.
* However, when it comes to the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), we can see that Linear Regression has a slightly lower value (0.482) compared to Ridge Regression (0.498).
* Considering both the R2 Score and MAE, we can conclude that the Linear Regression model performs slightly better than the Ridge Regression model in terms of prediction accuracy. but We would prefer using the Ridge Regression model for making predictions because Ridge Regression can effectively address the problem of overfitting.
